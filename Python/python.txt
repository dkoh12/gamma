**str vs unicode**

`str` is a string of bytes
`unicode` is meant to handle *text*. Text is a sequence of code points which may be bigger than 1 Byte. text can be encoded as raw bytes (`utf-8`, `latin-1`, etc)

unicode is not `encoded!!!`

in Python3, `str` is called `bytes`


**byte() vs bytearray()**

byte is immutable wheras bytearray is mutable
