difference between python string and unicode

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18034272/python-str-vs-unicode-types

str and unicode can both hold unicode strings

unicode which is python 3's `str` is meant to handle text.
text = sequence of code pts which many be bigger than single byte
unicode is not encoded!

str = plain sequence of bytes. Does not represent text!
in python3 `str` is called `bytes`

unicode = general representation of some text which can be encoded in many different ways into a sequence of binary data.

by default utf-8 takes 2 bytes.

-------

__repr__ goal is to be unambiguous (almost every object has this)
__str__ goal is to be readable (optional. pretty print)
container's __str__ uses contained objects' __repr__

Dynamic Programming - stacking boxes to get tallest height

have random string
abababbbacdcdcdcdbabacdcdbcbcbcbcbca
return longest 2 letter substring.

- use 2 arrays and 4 ints to keep track of current two substrings since each letter can be in at most two substrings. 

- Object Oriented - how would you design Asteroids game?
need Board class, Asteroid class, Rocket class, Bullet class, Parent class where asteroid and rocket extends from it. 

How would you determine the size of the asteroid? Have some kind of integer value from 1-9 to determine the size of the asteroid?

- indices on DB are good for lookups, but require extra storage, slows down updates/insert/delete and locking on tables could slow down queries altogether.
