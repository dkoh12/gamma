### Run

I use Python 3. 

> python datamine.py data.json locate CA

I made it so that you can apply multiple filters 

> python datamine.py data.json locate CA find_before 2000


### Tests

There are two ways to test it. One was making my own test(). The other way was using Python's unittest. Uncomment them to see it.
