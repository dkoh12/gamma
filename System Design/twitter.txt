1. Data Modeling
2. How to serve feeds

Data Modeling - Use relational DB, define `user` object and `feed` object. Two relations are necessary: 1. user can follow each other, 2. each feed has a user owner

Serve feeds - fetch feeds from all people you follow and render them by time

# when users follow a lot of people, fetching and rendering all their feeds can be costly. How to improve this?

Twitter has infinite scroll feature. Each time fetch the most recent N feeds instead of all of them. 

How should pagination be implemented?

Consider cache to speed things up

# detect fake users?

Machine Learning. Identify several features like registration data, number of followers, number of feeds, etc and build a machine learning system to detect if user is fake.
