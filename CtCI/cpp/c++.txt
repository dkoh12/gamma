What is a virtual function?

virtual functions are functions in base class that you can override in derived class. Support Run time polymorphism.

pure virtual function is one which must be overriden by any concrete (non-abstract) derived class. It is indicated with syntax " = 0" in the member's declaration.

interface = all functions must be virtual functions

abstract class = must have at least one virtual function but not necessarily all.
