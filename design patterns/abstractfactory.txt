#Difference Between "factory method" and "abstract factory"
* The main difference between a “factory method” and an “abstract factory” is that the factory method is a single method, and an abstract factory is an object.
* The factory method is just a method, it can be overridden in a subclass, whereas the abstract factory is an object that has multiple factory methods on it.
* The Factory Method pattern uses inheritance and relies on a subclass to handle the desired object instantiation.
