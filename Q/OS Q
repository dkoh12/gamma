purpose of OS
 - makes sure computer system performs well by managing its computational activities
 - provides environment for development and execution of programs
 - acts as a resource allocator and manager

 demand paging
 - demand paging is referred when not all of a process's pages are in RAM. OS brings the missing (and required) pages from disk to RAM

 adv in multiprocessor system?
 - increased number of processors, increase in throughput
 - save money because they can share resources
 - overall reliability is increased as well

 what is a kernel?
 - core of every OS
 - connects applications to actual processing of data
 - manages all communication between SW and HW components to ensure usability and reliability

 real-time systems?
 - real-time systems are used when rigid time requirements have been placed on the operation of a processor. It has defined and fixed time constraints

 virtual memory?
 - HW technique where system appears to have more memory than it actually does
 - memory management tool for letting processes execute outside of memory. Very useful especially in executing a program it cannot fit in physical memory

 objective of multiprogramming?
 - have process running at all times.
 - CPU utilization is maximized

 time sharing systems?
- In time sharing system, CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them, also known as multitasking. 

SMP
- Symmetric MultiProcessing
- most common type of multiple-processor systems. In each system, each processor runs an identical copy of OS and those copies communicate w/ one another as needed

How are server systems classified?
- Server systems can be classified as either computer-server systems or file server systems. In the first case, an interface is made available for clients to send requests to perform an action. In the second case, provisions are available for clients to create, access, and update files

What is asymmetric clustering?
- In asymmetric clustering, a machine is in a state known as hot standby mode where it does nothing but to monitor the active server. That machine takes the active server's role should the server fails

thread?
- program line under execution
- thread is basic unit of CPU utilization. In general a thread is composed of a threadID, program counter, register set, and the stack

adv of multithreading?
- increased responsiveness to user
- resource sharing within process
- economy
- utliization of multiprocessing architecture

FCFS
- First Come First Served scheduling alg. Process that requests CPU first is allocated the CPU first. Implementation is managed by FIFO queue.

Round Robin Scheduling
- scheduling algorithm primarily aimed for time-sharing systems. A circular queue is setup in such a way that the CPU scheduler goes around that queue, allocating CPU to each process for a time interval of around 10 - 100 ms

Deadlocks?
- can occur in 1 of 4 situations: 
- mutual exclusion (at least one resource is non-shareable)
- hold and wait (process holds one resource and waits for another)
- no preemption (where resources can't be preempted)
- circular wait (waiting for each other's resources)

RAID levels?
- RAID 0: non redundant striping
- RAID 1: mirrored disks
- RAID 2: memory-style error-correcting codes
- RAID 3: bit-interleaved parity
- RAID 4: block-interleaved parity
- RAID 5: block-interleaved distributed parity
- RAID 6: P+Q redundancy

Banker's alg
- one of deadlock-avoidance alg. It gets its name from a banking system wherein the bank never allocates available cash in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the needs of all of its customers.

what factors determine whether a detection-alg must be utilized in a deadlock avoidance system?
- one is how often a deadlock is likely to occur under implementation of this alg
- two is how many processes will be affected by deadlock when this alg is applied

logical vs physical addr space?
- logical address refers to address that is generated by CPU (virtual address space)
- physical address refers to address that is seen by memory unit
- they will be same at compile time but different at execution time

how does dynamic loading aid in better memory space utilization?
- with dyanmic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is called. Especially useful when large amounts of code are needed in order to handle infrequently occurring cases such as error routines

overlays?
- overlays enable process to be larger than the amount of memory allocated to it. basic idea is that only instructions and data that are needed at any given time are kept in memory

basic function of paging?
- paging is memory management scheme that permits physical address space of process to be noncontiguous. It avoids considerable problem of having to fit varied sized memory chunks onto backing store

fragmentation?
- memory wasted. Internal vs External fragmentation. 

how does swapping result in better memory management?
- during regular intervals set by OS, processes can be copied from Main memory to a backing store then copied back later. swapping allows more processes to be run that can fit into memory at one time. 

Example of process state
- new state (process created)
- running (instructions are executing)
- waiting (waiting for certain conditions or events to occur)
- ready (waiting for instruction from main processor)
- terminate (done executing)

socket?
- provides connection between two applications. Each endpoint of a communication is a socket

direct access method?
- direct access method is based on a disk model of a file, such that it is viewed as a numbered sequence of blocks or records. allows arbitrary blocks to be read or written. Direct access is advantageous when accessing large amounts of information

when designing file structure for OS, what attributes are considered?
- naming, identified, supported file types, location for files, size, and level of protection

root partition?
- where OS kernel is located. contains other potentially important system files that are mounted during boot time.

device drivers?
- provide standard means of representing I/O devices that may be manufactured by different companies. 

primary function of VFS (virtual file system)?
- virtual file system separates file system generic operations from their implementation by defining a clean VFS interface. Based on file-representation structure known as vnode, which contains numerical designator needed to support network file systems.

different types of CPU registers in OS design?
- accumulators
- index registers
- stack pointers
- general purpose registers

purpose of I/O status information?
- I/O status information provides info about which I/O devices are to be allocated for a particular process. Shows which files are opened and other I/O device state.

multitasking
- process within OS that allows users to run several applications at the same time. Only one application is active at a time although some can run in the background

interrupts?
- interrupts are part of HW mechanism that sends notifications to the CPU when it wants to gain access to a particular resource. Interrupt handler receives this interrupt signal and "tells" processor to take action based on interrupt request

preemptive multitasking?
- allows OS to switch between SW programs. Allows multiple programs to run w/o taking complete control over processor and resulting in system crash

why is partitioning and formatting a prerequisite to installing an OS?
- partitioning and formatting creates a prepatory environment on the drive so that OS can be copied and installed properly. Includes allocating space on drive, designating a drive name, determining and creating appropriate file system structure.

piping/ plumbing?
- process of using output of one program as input to another

NOS?
- network OS. specialized SW that will allow computer to communicate w/ other devices over the network, including file/folder sharing

spooling?
- associated with printing. when different applications want to send an output to printer at the same time, spooling takes all of these print jobs into a disk file and queues them accordingly to printer.

semaphore?
- variable whose status reports common resource

starvation?
- resource management problem where a process does not get the resources it needs for a long time because resources are being allocated to other processes

aging?
- technique to avoid starvation in a scheduling alg

context switching?
- transfer control from one process to another requires saving the state of the old process and loading the saved state of the new process

race condition? 
- when several processes access and manipulate same data concurrently and outcome of execution depends on particular order in which access takes place

process synchronization?
- to guard against race conditions, ensure that only one process at a time can manipulate the same data. 

thrashing?
- processor spends more time swapping pages rather than executing instructings. Due to inordinate number of page faults
