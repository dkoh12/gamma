**important concepts** 

Hashtables, Trees, Graphs

Hashtables
- most important data structure.
- should be able to implement them using only arrays.

Trees
- construction, traversal, manipulation
- binary, n-ary, trie
- balanced: red/black, splay, AVL
- bfs, dfs
- preorder, inorder, postorder

Graphs 
- objects & ptrs, matrix, adj list
- bfs, dfs

OS
- processes, threads, concurrency issues
- locks, mutexes, semaphores, and monitors
- deadlock, livelock and how to avoid them
- context switch and how its initiated by OS
- scheduling

language
- C++, Java, Python, UNIX, Ruby, Javascript
