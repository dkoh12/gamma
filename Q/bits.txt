Bits and Bytes

2^5 = 32
2^10 = 1024
2^16 = 65,536

and, or, not, xor

bitwise and vs logical and
(byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean). how much space is allocated.

difference between signed and unsigned types and the range.


A good weeder question for this area is:
```
Tell me how to test whether the high-order bit is set in a byte.
```

Another, more involved one is:
```
Write a function to count all the bits in an int value; e.g. the function with the signature int countBits(int x)
```

Another good one is:
```
Describe a function that takes an int value, and returns true if the bit pattern of that int value is the same if you reverse it (i.e. it's a palindrome); i.e. boolean isPalindrome(int x)
```


sizeof(). when to use it and why.
count in hexadecimal. convert between hex, binary, oct
