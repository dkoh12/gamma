#RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

#Raid 0 (Striping)
splits data evenly across 2 or more disks w/o parity info, redundancy or fault tolerance.

Failure will result in total data loss.

Goal: Speed. Used to increase performance

Uses: Scientific computing, Gaming

#Raid 1 (Mirroring)
Contains a mirrored pair of data. No parity, striping, or spanning of disk space. 

Useful when read is more important than write. 

SSDs have a RAID 1 setup


#Raid 4
Same as Raid 5 but has a dedicated parity disk

```
A1  A2  A3  Ap
B1  B2  B3  Bp
C1  C2  C3  Cp
D1  D2  D3  Dp
```

#Raid 5 (distributed parity)
Consists of block level striping w/ distributed parity. Parity info is distributed among drives. Upon failure of single drive, subsequent reads can be calculated from distributed parity such that no data is lost.


```
A1  A2  A3  Ap
B1  B2  Bp  B3
C1  Cp  C2  C3
Dp  D1  D2  D3
```



#Raid 6 (dual parity)
Same as Raid 5 but has 2 parity blocks. And as a result can handle 2 or more disk failures


```
A1  A2  A3  Ap  Aq
B1  B2  Bp  Bq  B3
C1  Cp  Cq  C2  C3
Dp  Dq  D1  D2  D3
Eq  E1  E2  E3  Ep
```
